# movie-api
While in school (Fall 2012) we had to create an app/website which used as least one API. I created this app which used the APIs of Netflix, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDB. The IMDB API is not the official API from IMDB, but an API someone else build using IMDB. At the time Netflix had a public API, but they have turned it off so it is not longer public.

A user can search for a movie by title and the App will return the netflix image and the Rotten Tomatoes score. It uses IMDB to
get the common names based on the search.
